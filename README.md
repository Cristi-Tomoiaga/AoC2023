# AoC2023

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/) puzzles using Kotlin 1.9.21 and JDK 17.0.7

Each day has a package with the source files (in general[^1] `Main.kt`) and the test input from the problem statement (contained in `data/dayXX/test*.txt`).

## Testing the solutions

1. Make sure you have Kotlin 1.9.21 and JDK 17.0.7 installed on your machine
2. Create a new file called `input.txt` in the `data/dayXX` folder and copy your personal input there
3. Compile the project and run the `main` method from the `Main.kt` file
